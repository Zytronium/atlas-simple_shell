# Simple Shell

##### Why was the shell always invited to computer parties?

###### Because it knew how to "grep" everyone's attention

---
A shell is a program that interprets and executes system commands,
like `ls`, `git commit`, or `rm -rf /*`. (Tip: ***never*** run `rm -rf /*   `)
A shell should take text input; read and parse it; execute the command,
if valid; print output, if there is any; and repeat. You can navigate
a file system; create, edit, delete, and run files; and maybe even access
the internet using a shell. A couple examples of a shell are Bash and
PowerShell. Examples of things that may be confused with a shell, but
are **not** are: the terminal/console, Vim, Ubuntu, or the Sandbox/VM.

### Examples of this concept:

Example input/output:
```
Welcome to the Gates Of Shell. Type "exit" to quit.

```

This shell is called the Gates of Shell. The prompt, `[Go$H] | SmartFridge@fedora:/home/SmartFridge/CLionProjects/atlas-simple_shell$ `,
consists of:
- `[Go$H]` (which stands for Gates of Shell) - helps differentiate the shell
from the real shell, as the rest of the prompt looks
identical to an Ubuntu prompt;
- `User` - the user's username or log name, taken from the environment variables
- `Hostname` or PC name - usually the user's Linux distro or the user's PC name
- `Path` - the current working directory
- `$` - end of prompt (not sure what to call this, but some shells may use
`:` or `#` instead)

**Custom Commands**
- exit - exits the shell
- quit - exits the shell
- selfdestr - activates self-destruct sequence, counts down from a
user-specified number, or 5 if unspecified, and then exits the shell
- self-destruct - activates self-destruct sequence, counts down from a
user-specified number, or 5 if unspecified, and then exits the shell
- env - prints the environment variables
- setenv - sets an environment variable
- unsetenv - deletes an environment variable
